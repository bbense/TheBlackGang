A script to manage the workflow of various email tools to keep me from punching the screen everytime I need to get email from Exchange. 

For various reasons I want to stick with using alpine as the email client at least for my "working set" email. I would
like to archive everything with a quick search engine. This isn't really meant to work for anybody but me, but the information may help other people find similar work arounds for dealing with Exchange.
